“I’m talking to a lot of people and when the time is right, I will tell you”, he said. “we will tell you what we have discussed  at the right time, so that you can  also chime in and tell us what you think, ensuring we never find ourselves in such a hole again.”
Gachagua added a touch of  humour by joking that if his followers are unable to contain their  frustrations, they should express them “through songs and dance” rather than direct confrontation, reinforcing his call for peace in the midst of rising political tensions
