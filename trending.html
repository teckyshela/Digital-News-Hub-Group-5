<h2><b>LSK condemns abduction of Ugandan opposition Leader Kiza Besigye</b></h2>
<p>The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) has expressed concern over the abduction of Ugandan opposition leader Kiza Besigye, who was scheduled to attend Martha Karua’s  book launch in Nairobi over the weekend.</p>

 <p>Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, LSK president Faith Odhiambo described the incident as an attack on democratic principles and a direct assault on the freedoms that define a democratic society.
She urged the International community to intervene immediately, emphasizing the importance of drawing global attention to this serious violation.
“We’re witnessing a return to an era of abductions and killings, which undermines media freedom and democratic process”, Odhiambo stated, urging swift international action to address the situation.
In addition  to this condemnation, LSK also highlighted ongoing issues with Kenya’s judicial and law enforcement systems, calling for urgent reforms.
The society expressed concern over corruption within the judiciary and the lack of transparency in handling cases, particularly those involving police misconduct.
Odhiambo called on the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) to work with LSK  to develop a comprehensive framework for addressing complaints, improving case tracking and ensuring public  accountability.
On the issue of misconduct, LSK demanded an immediate investigation into the torture and killings committed during the anti-finance Bill 2024 protests.
Odhiambo urged the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) to conduct thorough investigation and hold the perpetrators responsible.
She also demanded that the findings be used to launch disciplinary proceedings against the officers involved, and that cases be referred to the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) for criminal charges.
0dhiambo also criticized the Government’s inaction on extrajudicial killings and kidnappings, accusing the executive branch of paying only “lip service” to these serious issues.
The society urged greater political will to address these violations, which continue to undermine the rule of law in the country.</p>

<h2><b>ODM Condemns Woodley Estate demolitions</b></h2>
<p>The Orange Democratic Movement has condemned the demolition of residential apartments in Nairobi’s Woodley Estate on Monday night, describing it as a “colonial approach that should not happened in Kenya today”.</p>
<image src="anyang.png">
 
<p>In a statement, Acting ODM party leader and Kisumu Governor Prof. Anyang’ Nyong’o expressed deep concerns over the execution of the demolitions , stating that while the plan to use Woodley estates space for constructing high density apartments is welcome, the way the demolitions were carried out in the dead of night was both inhuman and appalling.
The better procedure would have been to develop a high density housing unit elsewhere and facilitate the transfer of woodley residents there in a humane and well organized manner. To  go out at night and bring down the houses is a colonial approach that should not happen in Kenya today,” said Anyang’ Nyong’o.
“The ODM party wishes to condemn demolitions and appeal to the Nairobi county Government not to be Pharisees in the execution of the law but to be humane in serving Kenyans.”
He added that the demolitions violated the constitution, particularly Article 43(1) (b), in which guarantees the right to adequate housing. He also pointed out that the demolitions contravened the United Nations guidelines on involuntary resettlement.
A total of 43 residents, including veteran broadcaster Sammy Lui, lost their homes during the demolitions. The residents opposed the move, arguing that they were not involved in the decision making process before the demolitions were carried out.</p>
