<h2><b>How Ajax Winger By then 2022 Nearly Replaced Salah</b></h2>

<h2><b>Antony’s agent reveals truth  behind transfer talks before interest in signing before Manchester united.</b></h2>

<p>The agent of Manchester united winger Antony has confirmed there is truth to reports revealing Liverpool’s interest in  signing the Brazilian back in 2022.
It emerged on Tuesday that former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp had discussed Antony, then a younger star with Ajax, as a potential replacement for Mohamed Salah, who was entering the final 12 months of his contract at the time and it appeared destined for exit door.</p><br>

<p>Salah ultimately signed a new deal that summer, until 2025, and Antony then sealed an initial $82m reunion with Erik Ten Hag at united instead.
Asked about the report, Antony’s agent Junior Pedroso told Winwin. “ Yes, this story has some basis in truth. Salah renewed his contract at the time and that made Antony’s move to Liverpool impossible.
While Liverpool have now firmly moved on from Antony, who is rumoured to be fighting for his future at united after two underwhelming seasons, the Reds one  again find themselves sweating over Salah’s contract at Anfield.
This time around, Salah is approaching the final six months of his current deal and, as it stands, can discus a free transfer overseas from January. Clubs in Saudi Arabia believed to be keen on his signature.</p>

<p>Rodrigo Bentancur has been hit with a $100,000 fine and seven-match suspension by the Football Association  after making racist comments about Son Heung-min during summer.

<p>Bentancur said “they all look the same”  when he was asked to show the difference between Son and his cousin on Uruguayan television and the length of his ban was leaked last week. Now, the FA have confirmed his suspension for bringing the game into disrepute with a breach of FA Rule E31, acting in an “improper manner and or use  of abusive or insulting words.
Their statement reads (FA), “An independent Regulatory Commission has imposed a seven-ban match suspension and $100,000 fine on Rodrigo Bentancur for  breach of FA Rule E31 in relation to a media interview.
“It was alleged that the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder breached FA Rule E31 as he acted in an improper manner or used abusive/insulting words or brought the game into disrepute. It was further alleged that this constitutes an “aggravated breach”, which is defined in FA Rule E3.2, as it included a referee whether express or implied to a nationality, race or ethnic region.
Bentancur denied this charge , but the independent Regulatory Commission found it to be proven and imposed his sanctions following a hearing.
Responding to the incident in June, Son said, “I’ve spoken to Rodrigo. He made a mistake, he knows this and he apologized. He would not mean to ever intentionally say something offensive. We’re brothers and nothing has changed at all.
Bentancur will now not be available for domestic games until boxing day. He will miss this weekend’s clash with Man City and subsequent matches against Fulham, Bournemouth, Chelsea, Southampton and Liverpool as well as Carabao cup quarter final with Man Utd.</p>
