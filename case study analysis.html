        <h2><i>Case Study Analysis Of Our Project<i></h2>
        <p>In the early stages of content development,we encountered a dilemma as we found an underdeveloped article online containing information on online journalism.It had an appealing heading and seemed wordy and members wanted to settle for it.However, after we read it,we found it short of descriptive language and mostly used short statements.It also contained many pages which had no clear flow and integration.It also had no clear sources of referencing.</p>
<p>Owing to this, we sat as a group to find a solution and the decision to move forward.First we sought to clarify the question on what would happen if we were to go ahead and use the problematic article. It became clear that it could have led to misinformation which would have in turn misled and may have had other issues of violation of privacy and copyright.</p>
<p>Consequently,we gathered enough information on it, though we found a little about it,leading to us  being cautious of misinformation, which could have occurred without our deliberate intent to mislead, but the  effect and the damages that may come along with it would have been our responsibility.We also sought for alternative sources of information on online journalism and we found better than it,in that they had  written material based on grounds relating to seeking truth and in compliance with the integrity and respect in collecting data, using the data and managing the user's personal data and in line with the law of  Copyright Act of 2001, which covers  protection of copyright and related rights, infringement and enforcement, exceptions and works in the public domain, collective management of copyright, and administrative issues.</p>
<p>We evaluated the options we had and the resourceful articles outweighed our first find with all the compliances in regard to use and distribution of scholarly works,and therefore went ahead to refer to them.</p>
<p>We acted on the final decision as we compiled the content on AI emerging trends from these sources.</p>
<p>Finally,after reviewing the results, everything was in line as per:
Fair Use;for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching and research.</p>
<p>Access to information Act ;In Kenya, the Access to Information Act 2016 which gives citizens the right to access information held by the state or other people. The law also requires the government to publish important information in the public interest.All the members checked and agreed that every bit was good and we kept it as the final content we included on our platform.</p>
